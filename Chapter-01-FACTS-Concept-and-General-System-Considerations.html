<h2 id="transmission-interconnections">Transmission Interconnections</h2>
<p>Most if not all of the world's electric power supply systems are
widely interconnected, involving connections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside utilities' own territories which extend to</li>
<li>Inter-utility interconnections and then to</li>
<li>Inter-regional and</li>
<li>International connections.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is done for <strong>economic reasons</strong>, to reduce the cost of
electricity and to improve reliability of power supply.</p>

<h3 id="advantages-of-transmission-line-interconnections">Advantages of transmission line interconnections</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital cost reduction</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an incremental system, it is possible to have larger generators rating because excess capacity of a'station may be utilized by the areas fed by other station’s as <strong>the size of the generator increases the capital Cost per kW reduce.</strong> Therefore, a saving is achieved capital cost. it is most useful advantages of interconnected system.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Installed Capacity Saving</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An interconnection is likely to decrease the installed capacity need to meet the load requirement. In majority of cases, it happens that <strong>the maximum demand of one area does not coincide with the maximum demand of another area.</strong> This could be because in one agea the major load is the industrial load while, in the other it is residential and commercial. If two such areas are interconnected, the diversity of load would cause the maximum combined demand to be less than the sun of the individual maximum demand.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Savings</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When two different utilities are operating separately, each would run its units most economically. however, when the two are interconnected and the optimum scheduling is decided for the combined system, the operating costs are likely to decrease. Thus, energy interchanges between the^wo would result in saving for both. It is basic interconnected power system advantages.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increase in Service Reliability</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every equipment is prone to putage during its operation. System interconnection leads to increase in reliability of electric supply, in the event of one utility falling short of generation, due to forced outage of generator or unexpected increase in demand, another utility of the pool can come to its rescue by making its surplus power available. An interconnection between the local transmission systems of two utility can lead to an increase in service reliability at considerably less expense than that which both would have to incur in the construction of additional lines. When the lines are fed from more than one-generation source, the reliability is still further improved.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decrease in Spinning Reserve Requirements</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every utility has to keep some generation capacity as reserve to take into account of capacity reduction due to forced outage and scheduled maintenance. as a thumb rule, a capacity equal to the capacity of the largest unit is kept as reserve. When two systems operate separately, each has to maintain a separate reserve capacity. If they are interconnected, it may be sufficient to have a smaller total reserve for the combine system for the same degree and reliability.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Addition and Replacement of Transmission Facilities</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Load growth necessitates additionl transmission facilities the questions like cost or right of way and installation of line and the Territory to be served can be more economically and easily decided when bmore than one utility is involved. The utilities can share the cost and use of the lines. This would evidently lead to optimum use of facilities.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages-of-transmission-line-interconnections">Disadvantages of transmission line interconnections</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Expensive Circuit Breakers</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interconnection causes larger curents to flow on the transmission lines under faulty condition with a consequent Increase in capacity of circuit breakers therefore, expensive circuit breakers are required with interconnected system.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expensive tie Lines</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interconnection of generating station involves expenses for construction of interconnecting transmission line between generating stations or arias. These lines are called tie lines.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Synchronizing Problem</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The generators of all the inter-connected generating stations must operate at all same frequency and in a synchronized manner.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inadequate Transmission Facilities</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The transmission system has not been strengthened to proper level. This has resulted in problem of power evaluation from large pithead super thermal station. Additional investment in transmissioin system is needed. There should be adequate redundancy in transmission system for satisfactory operation of grid.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metering and Instrumentation</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adequate metering and instrumentation is needed at different level. It is necessary to install sequential recorders, disturbance recorders, time of day meters etc.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flow-of-power-in-an-ac-system">Flow of Power in an AC System</h2>
<p>In ac power systems, given the insignificant electrical storage, the electrical generation and load must balance at all times.</p>
<figure style="margin: 20px auto; text-align: center;">
    <img src="img/ch2-03.png" alt="Flow of Power" width="480">
    <figcaption><b>Flow of Power</b></figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>To some extent, the electrical system is self-regulating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If generation is less than load, the voltage and frequency drop, and thereby the load, goes down to equal the generation minus the transmission losses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, there is only a few percent margin for such a self-regulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>What happened if exceeding the margin of self-regulation?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If voltage is propped up with reactive power support, then the load will go up, and consequently frequency will keep dropping, and the system will collapse.</li>
<li>Alternately, if there is inadequate reactive power, the system can have voltage collapse.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>

<li>Meshed circuits</li>
<li>Interconnected system</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cases-of-load-flow">Cases of load flow</h3>
<p>Consider power flow through two parallel paths (possibly corridors of several lines) from a surplus generation area, shown as an equivalent generator on the left, to a deficit generation area on the right.</p>

<li>Without any control, power flow is based on the inverse of the various transmission line impedances.</li>
<li>The lower impedance line may become overloaded.</li>

<li>With HVDC, power flows as ordered by the operator, because with HVDC power electronics converters power is electronically controlled.</li>
<li>Also, because power is electronically controlled, the HVDC line can be used to its full thermal capacity if adequate converter capacity is provided.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Suppose the lines AB, BC, and AC have continuous ratings of 1000 MW, 1250 MW, and 2000 MW, respectively, and have emergency ratings of twice those numbers for a sufficient time to allow rescheduling of power in case of loss of one of these lines.</p>

<p>If one of the generators is generating 2000 MW and the other 1000 MW, a total of 3000 MW would be delivered to the load center. For the impedances shown, the three lines would carry 600, 1600, and 1400 MW, respectively, as shown in Figure (a).</p>

</figure>
<p>Such a situation would overload line BC (loaded at 1600 MW for its continuous rating of 1250 MW), and therefore generation would have to be decreased at B, and increased at A, in order to meet the load without overloading line BC.</p>

<p>If a capacitor whose reactance is - 5 ohms is inserted to line AC Figure (b), it reduces the line’s impedance from 10 Q to 5 Q, so that power flow through the lines AB, BC, and AC will be 250,1250, and 1750 MW, respectively.</p>

<p>As another option, a thyristor-controlled phase-angle regulator could be installed instead of a series capacitor or a series reactor in any of the three lines to serve the same purpose.</p>

In Figure (d), the regulator is installed in the third line to reduce the total phase angle difference along the line from 8.5 degrees to 4.26 degrees.

<p>The current flow phasor is perpendicular to the driving voltage (90° phase lag). If the angle between the two bus voltages is small, the current flow largely represents the active power.</p>
<p>Increasing or decreasing the inductive impedance of a line will greatly affect the active power flow.</p>
<p><strong>Thus impedance control</strong>, which in reality provides current control, can be the most cost effective means of controlling the power flow. With appropriate control loops, it can be used for power flow control and/or angle control for stability.</p>

<p>It is easy to appreciate that without high-speed control of any of the parameters $E_{1},;E_{2},;E_{1}-E_{2},;X\mathrm{,and};\delta$, the transmission line can be utilized only to a level well below that corresponding to 90 degrees.</p>
<p>This is necessary, in order to maintain an adequate margin needed for transient and dynamic stability and to ensure that the system does not collapse following the outage of the largest generator and/or a line.</p>

<p>Power/current flow can also be controlled by <strong>regulating the magnitude of voltage</strong> phasor $E_1$ or voltage phasor $E_2$.</p>
<p>However, it is seen from (e) that with change in the magnitude of $E_1$ the magnitude of the driving voltage phasor $E_2 - E_2$ does not change by much, but its phase angle does.</p>

<h3 id="thyristor-and-gto">Thyristor and GTO</h3>
<p>A normal thyristor or conventional thyristor is used as an ideal switch for power electronic circuits. However, for turning off the device, a communication circuit is required, which increases the complexity and weight of the circuit.</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations, the Gate Turn-Off Thyristor (GTO) was introduced. GTOs use a gate signal to turn on and off, eliminating the need for a communication circuit.</p>
<figure style="margin: 20px auto; text-align: center;">
	<img src="img/ch2-37.jpg" alt="" width="480">
	<figcaption><b>Principle of Operation</b>
	</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="turn-on-operation">Turn-On Operation</h4>
<p>The turn-on operation of a GTO is similar to that of a conventional thyristor. When a positive gate signal is applied, the hole current injection from the gate forward biases the cathode p-base junction. This results in the emission of electrons from the cathode towards the anode terminal, inducing hole injection from the anode terminal into the base region. This injection of holes and electrons continues until the GTO comes into the conduction state.</p>
<p>In contrast, the conduction in a thyristor starts initially by turning on the area of the cathode adjacent to the gate terminal. The remaining area comes into conduction by plasma spreading.</p>
<h4 id="turn-off-operation">Turn-Off Operation</h4>
<p>To turn off a conducting GTO, a reverse bias is applied at the gate by making the gate negative with respect to the cathode. A part of the holes from the P base layer is extracted through the gate, which suppresses the injection of electrons from the cathode. In response to this, more hole current is extracted through the gate, resulting in more suppression of electrons from the cathode. Eventually, the voltage drop across the p base junction causes the gate cathode junction to reverse bias, turning off the GTO.</p>
<p>The GTO can be turned off by the application of reverse gate current, which can be either step or ramp drive. The GTO can be turned off without reversing the anode voltage. During turn-off, the GTO can block a rated forward voltage only.</p>

<p>Compared to thyristors, GTOs have the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>No communication circuit is required for turning off the device.</li>
<li>GTOs can be turned off by the application of reverse gate current, which can be either step or ramp drive.</li>
<li>GTOs can be turned off without reversing the anode voltage.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, GTOs also have some limitations:</p>
<ul>

<p>IGBT stands for Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor. An IGBT is also a three terminal semiconductor device used for switching purposes. The IGBT is a type of transistor that has ability to handle large amount of power and has high switching speed which makes it more efficient than a BJT. The three terminals of the IGBT are: emitter (E), gate (G) and collector (C).</p>
